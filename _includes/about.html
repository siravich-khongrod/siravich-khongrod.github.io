                <p>From the field of space-time-relativity, some believe that the higher dimensions might be out of bounds of our universe. I believe we are living in the third dimension for having either time or spatial position as the fourth dimension. These choices have always been ambigious. Still, we attempt with struggle to visualize these data. This was why I have chosen time series and geospatial data analysis as my electives.</p>
                <p>Envisioning the future, I tell myself these are the essential skills that would suffice my career path. Over the past years I have shaped myself to be fully equipted with analytic skills that allow me to further strive to the management role directly involved with the Data Analytics.</p>
                <p>Storytelling, was the one that I pin essenceand put my best effort. I demonstrate this skill by ellaborating through the projects I have developed over the past years. The project ideas are mostly practical, meaning they are in real world application, not only academic or theoretical. The art of conveying complex ideas would connect my world of computing to the ecosystem of business network leading to the future of technology.</p>
